It was hard to take in, so that's why we look so upset. \n\nQ: Where did you go? For how long? When?\nA: Ethiopia and Uganda. 2 Weeks. Summer of 2011.\n\nQ: Why'd you go?\nA: Us Dude Perfect guys believe in Jesus. He's the most important part of our lives, and we felt like this trip was something He wanted us to do. Almost every kid you see in this video is an orphan. So by hanging out with them, we got a chance to show love to kids that simply don't get a lot of love, especially from male role models. We wanted to love these kids the way Jesus does. And it was a blast. We can't wait to go back.\n\nQ: How good were these kids at soccer?\nA: Super good. It wasn't a fair fight.\n\nQ: Only 2 shots?\nA:Obviously the purpose of our trip wasn't to make basketball shots, but we wanted to make sure we did at least a couple. By doing something we love, we hope to help these super legit kids!\n\nSpecial thanks to Nerf & Spalding for donating the sports equipment that brought countless smiles to these awesome kids on the other side of the world!!!\n\nMusic: \"Begging You Alive\" by Courrier\nShow 'em some love!\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/album/a-violent-flame/id415691001\n\nOther incredible groups we worked with:\nSixty Feet - http://sixtyfeet.org\nDig Deep - http://www.aglimmerofhope.org/campaign/dig-deep?page=26\n\nHang out with us!\n\nFACEBOOK\nhttp://fb.me/DudePerfect\nTWITTER\nhttp://twitter.com/DudePerfect \nNEW BOOK\nhttp://www.DudePerfect.com/GoBigBook\niPHONE GAME\nhttp://bit.ly/DudePerfectGame\n\n\nThanks for all the incredible support guys!!\nWe have a blast making these videos and we can't wait to show you what's next!"}, {"Title": "Play the Dude Perfect Game! - Official Trailer", "Description": "Play the DUDE PERFECT GAME here!\niPhone/iPod - http://bit.ly/DPGameiPhone\nAndroid - http://bit.ly/DPGameAndroid\niPad - http://bit.ly/DPGameiPad\nKindle Fire - http://amzn.to/M8i6pJ\n\nWe're really stinkin' super proud of the Dude Perfect Game and we love how much you guys love it!
