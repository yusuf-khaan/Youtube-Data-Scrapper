The pair lived on the sheer vertical cliff for weeks, igniting a frenzy of global media attention. But for Tommy Caldwell, The Dawn Wall was much more than just a climb. It was the culmination of a lifetime defined by overcoming obstacles. At the age of 22, the climbing prodigy was taken hostage by rebels in Kyrgyzstan. Shortly after, he lost his index finger in an accident, but resolved to come back stronger. When his marriage fell apart, he escaped the pain by fixating on the extraordinary goal of free climbing The Dawn Wall. Blurring the line between dedication and obsession, Caldwell and his partner Jorgeson spend six years meticulously plotting and practicing their route. On the final attempt, with the world watching, Caldwell is faced with a moment of truth. Should he abandon his partner to fulfill his ultimate dream, or risk his own success for the sake of their friendship?\n\n_\n\nExperience the world of Red Bull like you have never seen it before.

The pair lived on the sheer vertical cliff for weeks, igniting a frenzy of global media attention. But for Tommy Caldwell, the Dawn Wall was much more than just a climb. It was the culmination of a lifetime defined by overcoming obstacles. At the age of 22, the climbing prodigy was taken hostage by rebels in Kyrgyzstan. Shortly after, he lost his index finger in an accident, but resolved to come back stronger. When his marriage fell apart, he escaped the pain by fixating on the extraordinary goal of free climbing the Dawn Wall. Blurring the line between dedication and obsession, Caldwell and his partner Jorgeson spend six years meticulously plotting and practicing their route. On the final attempt, with the world watching, Caldwell is faced with a moment of truth. Should he abandon his partner to fulfill his ultimate dream, or risk his own success for the sake of their friendship?\n\n_\n\nExperience the world of Red Bull like you have never seen it before.

Four decades later, On Any Sunday: The Next Chapter shows that the passion for riding motorcycles is as strong as ever. Bruce's son, acclaimed filmmaker Dana Brown, directs this modern take on the original, capturing what it means to ride in the United States and globally. Shot in 4K Ultra HD, the action and emotion are breathtaking: phenomenal athletes, revolutionary innovators, Hollywood stars and even visionaries who use moto to save lives.

The speed of attacks and hits is so fast \u2013 it's quite hard to follow with an untutored eye.\n\nUkrainian fencer Olga Kharlan not only understands what's happening in those seconds, but also excels at scoring winning hits. Fencing isn't about force. Rather, the ability to choose the right position and distance is the key. The faster fencer will 'step-lunge', which offers more chances to land a hit first. The speed of this move made by professional athletes can be compared to the acceleration of a race car.\n\nWhat if we put Kharlan next to Alexander Grinchuk\u2019s 600hp #RedBull350z, which accelerates up to 100km in four seconds, on the starting line?

His vision was to take wakeskating completely out of the summer environment and put it in winter conditions.\nAnd, to spice things up, to combine water and snow elements for the first time. \nHis quest brought him to Studeni Potok (Icy Creek) on Bjelasnica plateau, near the village Umoljani. What they've found there was a snowy wonderland amidst untouched mountain wilderness. Icy Creek lies at the bottom of a snow covered valley, winding its countless curves through the thick white blanket. The locals also call the creek Dragon's Tail.\nPreparing combined snow/water course in heavy terrain and weather conditions was quite a task. Pulled by one of the longest winch lines (1300ft), he carved his way through the deep snow at one moment, wakeskating in the creek at next, back to snow, then creek again \u2013 performing some of his favorite tricks on water and snow.  \nIt\u00b4s a sort of mixture of wake and snowskating\u2026 something that lacks a name?\n\nMusic: \nAWOLNATION\nHollow Moon (Bad Wolf) http://smarturl.it/hollowmoon \n\n_\n\nExperience the world of Red Bull like you have never seen it before.

The two teams unveiled the new Red Bull F1 Energy Station, aka the F1 Holzhaus (or Wood House) at the Spanish Grand Prix, that will act as their joint base at eight other European races this season.\n\nWhile simplicity lies at the heart of our new Energy Station\u2019s function, it\u2019s a very complex structure. So, just to keep things interesting, after the Spanish Grand Prix, the crew will be taking it down in a hurry, transporting it to Imperia on the Italian Riviera, and rebuilding it there on a barge, to be towed to Monte Carlo. Due to the tight space restrictions in the dramatic Monaco harbour, the Energy Station needs to be built on a barge, where it will then make the journey by sea to Monaco.\n\nWith 265,000 kilos of sustainably sourced timber and 85 windows being moved into millimetre perfect positions, it can be a difficult process. With heavy rains and storms forecasts, the question is, can the team complete the build and transport the energy station to Monaco in time for the Grand Prix?\n\n\n\u25baFor regular F1 Content check out: \n\nRed Bull Racing: https://www.youtube.com/redbullracing\nScuderia Toro Rosso: https://www.youtube.com/ToroRossoOfficial\n\n_\n\nExperience the world of Red Bull like you have never seen it before.

Two more waves tossed her around as her body went limp and she slipped in and out of consciousness before fellow Brazilian Carlos Burle was able to rescue her.

With much physical and psychological preparation, along with two hernia surgeries to her back, Gabeira got back to the place that once changed her life forever.
