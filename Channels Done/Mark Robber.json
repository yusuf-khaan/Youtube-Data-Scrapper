Basically, you throw a dart and then a Vicon motion capture system tracks the dart in the air.  We use those x,y,z positions in matlab to predict where the dart will land using some regression analysis.  Once we know where it will land, we move the board to the right spot using 6 stepper motors that attach to the back of the board using fishing line.  All of this happens in 400ms or so.

Anytime you have a sudden change in cross-sectional area in the horn you will get waves reflecting back at the source.  You don't want that because that is wasted energy that could have moved forward.  Even if it goes from a small cross-section to a larger, if you do it suddenly you get those wasted waves.  So you want the horn to basically be asymptotic at the exit so you never have a jump in discontinuity when it exits to the wide open air.  So a directors cone isn't as good as the curved shapes I showed because it still has the sudden change when it dumps into the open air.\n\n\n\nMUSIC-\n0:10- Arrow- Andrew Applepie - http://andrewapplepie.com/\n1:08- Dance- Danijel Zambo- https://danijel-zambo.bandcamp.com/\n2:00- Kalimba Jam- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/\n3:00- New shoes- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/\n7:30- Ceral Killa- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/\n8:47- Q- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/\n9:46 Too Happy to be cool by Notebreak- https://soundcloud.com/notebreak/dubstep-too-happy-to-be-cool\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary:  I made a huge horn and broke glass with it and explored why horns are shaped the way they are.\n\n\n\nMERCH-\nThey are soft- https://teespring.com/stores/markrober\n\n\nPLEASE CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING: http://tinyurl.com/MarkRober-Sub\n\n****************************************\u00ad\n\nI make videos like this once a month all year long while supplies last:\n\nCHECK OUT MY CHANNEL: http://tinyurl.com/MarkRober-YouTube\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/MarkRoberYouTube\n\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/#!/MarkRober\n\nINSTAGRAM:  https://www.instagram.com/markrober/"}, {"Title": "Beating iPhone Heart Halloween Costume + 20 more high-tech costumes", "Description": "NO MORE DUCT TAPE OR SCISSORS REQUIRED for 2013!!!

You're going to follow along with me as I fully design and engineer 3 brand new builds from scratch... from how I come up the idea, all the way through bringing the final builds to life. The best part is, over the month, you'll follow along with me and my process, side by side, and you will leave the class with 3 original, creative builds of your own. This is the class I wish I had when I was starting out. It's designed to take your skills to make cool stuff to the next level, whether you're a beginner or a more experienced maker/engineer. The class officially starts in early Jan, and it will only run a few times per year, so claim your spot if you're interested! See you in class!
