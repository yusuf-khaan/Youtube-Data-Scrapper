This test is split into many different categories, for example \u201cUltrawide video quality\u201d or \u201clow-light zoom photography\u201d\n2. Each category is assigned an importance rating out of 10, for example, \u201cdaylight photography\u201d, which gets a 10 is far more important for most people than \u201c5x Zoom video in Low-light\u201d, which gets a 2\n3. Within each category, each phone gets a score out of 10 for how good it is in that category. \n4. The number of points a phone gets in each category = Importance of category x Score in that category.  For example, if the Huawei P30 Pro scored 5/10 in a catgory that\u2019s 5/10 important, then The P30 Pro\u2019s score for this category would be 5 x 5 = 25 points\n5.
